Copiste project
Antonin Delpeuch

This project provides a small set of tools around audio classification.

What can be done currently :

### nnat : Neural Network Analysis Tool ###
This tool takes a neural network described in an XML format
(see the networks directory for examples) and trains it to
fit a given corpus, described in another XML format (see the
corpus directory for examples). It can also evaluate how good
a network fits a corpus, and provides a small graphical interface
that can be used to visualize 2D networks.

### featdraw : Feature Drawer ###
This tool takes an audio file and draws the variations of some
features in this file. The features are described by a pipeline
(XML file, see the pipeline directory), allowing the user to
change on the fly how features are computed.

### mkcorpus : Make Corpus ###
This tool uses a pipeline and a set of audio files to create
a corpus (as in nnat) where the features are written.
It uses another XML file, which defines the different audio
classes.

### specdraw : Draw Spectrum ###
This tool just takes as input an audio file and draws the
variations of the frequency spectrum during the time.


See help pages of all these tools for specific usage instructions.
